# Task Manager Game

A simple example of a web application built with Nest.js and Angular.

## Project Requirments

We assume that you have the latest Node.js, npm, and Angular CLI. In case you don't, please make sure to install them before you begin.

## Server Side

To start the server:
* Navigate into the `server` directory and run `npm i`
* Run `npm run start:dev`
* The server is now running on localhost port 3001

## Client Side

To start serving the client side:
* Open a new terminal and navigate into the `client` directory
* Run `npm i`
* Run `npm start`
* You can now access the app on [localhost port 4201](http://localhost:4201/auth).
(please note that since it's just a demo app there's no guard in the Angular project, so make sure to head to the `/auth` route :) )
